## Gameplay

The goal is simple: reach the red flag as fast as possible. **KimboUp** is designed to be fun and competitive, especially when played with friends. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Invite your friends and race against them in intense, fast-paced games.
- **Kimbo Tokens**: You can play with or without kimbo tokens. However, without tokens, you won't be able to save your scores or enjoy the full benefits of the play-to-earn model, which allows you to earn prizes like NFTs and tokens.
- **First Map: "CarCity"**: This is the first map available, and it serves as the starting point for unlocking future maps.
- **Competitions**: To make the game more exciting, weâ€™ll organize races where top scorers can win NFTs or tokens as prizes.
